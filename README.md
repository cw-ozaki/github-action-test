# MOD GitHub Actions
These official Terraform GitHub Actions allow you to run `terraform fmt`, `validate`, `plan` and `apply` on your pull requests to help you review, validate and apply Terraform changes.

## Getting Started
To get started, check out our documentation: [https://www.terraform.io/docs/github-actions/getting-started/](https://www.terraform.io/docs/github-actions/getting-started/).
